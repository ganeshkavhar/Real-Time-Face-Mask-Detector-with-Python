# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector-with-Python


During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.

We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.



# Face Mask Data
The dataset consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.

It is an excellent dataset for people who want to try learning techniques of deep learning for face mask detection.
